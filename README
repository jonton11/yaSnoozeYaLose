## STORIES
<hr>
- A user and the user's group of friends wish to improve themselves with a new habit.
  - We will denote habits as challenges.
- A user can create a team where the user's friends join.
- A user can have many teams by becoming a member of those teams.
- A user can then create a challenge. The challenge has a title, description, start_date, team (that it belongs to), and a reward.
- The other users in the team vote to accept or reject. If the challenge is accepted, a streak_count is initialized for each user for that habit.
- Users must track each day by marking the circle on the team page. If a user misses 3 days, they are disqualified.
- The users are eliminated until there is one remaining. The remaining user wins the reward.

User Signs Up or Signs In. Redirect to Team Show Page.

# every time a user does something for the day => create new record (streak event)

  # streak? = true/false
